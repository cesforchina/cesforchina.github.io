#NOTE:
##OpenLap will get a V2! There are not much information to show yet, but when we have something to show, we will do! So please stay patient and check FB group for any news! 
###One more thing : OpenLap V1 Transponders will get a workaround, but this workaround isnt easy to make, so we wanna reduce this to a minimum.. Before you build some transponders yourselfe, wait for the new ones ;) It wont take so long..

OpenLap is an open source IR laptimer for miniquad racing.

##Software

OpenLap is a cheap and easy to use system. It works with the famous [FPV Race Tracker Software by Andreas Neubauer](https://www.facebook.com/fpvracetracker/).

OpenLap has developed own transponders. They are only 14*19mm and below 1g!
60 IDs are supported this time. On the transponders is a button and led indicators for easy change of the ID.


##Receiver

Instead of other timing hardware OpenLap is really simple!
Only one 7$ board and four 1$ Sensors are necessary to make it work.
It can be used wireless (with a small extra tool running on your pc) or wired over USB.
No setup has to be done. Once uploaded the software the hardware detects automatic the software used.


##How to start

1. Grab a transponder (build one yourself or get one from an official reseller (currently working on this..)). If you build one yourself here's [how to upload the software](docs/Transponder%20Update.md). 
2. Plug it in a free 5V source. Make sure you can draw enough current. Short pulses are over 100mA. Maybe an extra 47-100µF Elko on 5V rails is recommended if you notice some trouble. To set up your transponder ID follow [this guide](docs/Transponder.md).
3. To set up the receiver follow [this guide](docs/Receiver.md).

Now you're ready to go :)

_ToDo :_  
_- Wireless Usage_  
_- What you need_


##What's next

I'm working on a big update, but it's currently a secret :P
Just kidding. I have to check if what I'm planning is actually possible. If it is I will post some info here soon ;)

##Weblinks

Main discussion about OpenLap occurs in the following Facebook group :

Most of the discussions are in German, but I will try to make an english version of my posts in the future. 

There's also an official website, but because of limited time the info there is out of date...
